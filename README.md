# blogofobe_blog

## What's this all about?

`blogofobe_blog` is a plugin for the static website compiler [`blogofobe`]

originally forked from the [Blogofile](http://blogofile.com) project.

## Aw man, another CMS?

Nope, that's what `blogofobe` is all about. No need for a database, or some
special server software. Heck, you don't even need to know HTML.
